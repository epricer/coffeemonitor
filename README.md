Hack to measure how much coffee remains in 2 carafe style pots

I build this project as a fun little hack and to familiarize myself with the particle photon.

It consists of:
1 Particle Photon
2 Strain gauges
1 HX711ADC Analog to digital converter
1 SSD1306 OLED display

Using webhooks, this can publish to a communication channel as well - in my case it was hipchat.
